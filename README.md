In the spirit of promoting an interest in system administration / web operations we decided to tackle this months challenge with infrastructure!  

Tech Stack:
- Vagrant
- Chef Solo
- Chefspec
- Serverspec
- Test Kitchen
- Nginx
- Lua

If you're building an artefact, you can and should test it with automated tests!!!
